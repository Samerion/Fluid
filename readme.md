![Hello World from Fluid!](./resources/hello-fluid.png)

A flexible UI library for [the D programming language](https://dlang.org/). Minimal setup. Declarative. Non-intrusive.

```d
auto root = vspace(
    .layout!"center",
    label(.layout!"center", "Hello World from"),
    imageView("./logo.png", Vector2(499, 240)),
);
```

Fluid comes with [Raylib 5][raylib] and [arsd.simpledisplay][sdpy] support. Integration is seamless: one or two calls do
the job.

```d
while (!WindowShouldClose) {

    BeginDrawing();

        ClearBackground(color!"#fff");
        root.draw();

    EndDrawing();

}
```

Fluid has a decent feature set at the moment and new features will still be added over time. Fluid is already mostly
stable and ready for use, but is still likely to receive a few breaking changes before leaving its pre-release stage.
